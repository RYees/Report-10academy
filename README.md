My understanding of the week0 project is to analysis the twitter data, arrange it in a way that when a data drift happens from the twitter an alert or notifcation should be triggered to indicate the drift incident.
MyProgress: I am beginner to data science so i do not know many of the data science terminlogies and the steps how to tackle a data to get an output is still new to me so since first day i am trying to change my knowledge in most matters as fast as i can with also trying to deliver the project on time. currently i am trying to finish today's task before submission

<!-- Task 2 Report  -->
There some changes i was able to make even though i could not seem to make everything work perfectly, my understanding about some things that were confusing me seems to be clearer a bit today but still i have a lot too learn.
Currently i am also working on task 3 on visualization and others
